##why i made this
learnin ~~react~~ (ill use react for something else) + electron for desktop app.. 

i would share the app, but its too big to upload to github (thats electron for ya) --> if you want it, contact me somehow :)


## potential updates
some things i would add:

- offline access (by importing own streams)
- station management (dynamic page construction -> react / json)
- tracker for how many minutes spent working / studying
- some ux improvements (ui coherency, sfx)

please let me humbly note that i already have all the logic for these features worked out.. im just too lazy / dont care to program them at this moment :/
