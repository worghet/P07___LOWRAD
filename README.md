## why i made this
learnin ~~react (ill use react for something else) and~~ electron for desktop app.. 

## potential updates
some things i would add:

- offline access (by importing own streams)
- station management (dynamic page construction -> react / json)
- tracker for how many minutes spent working / studying
- some ux improvements (ui coherency, more sfx)

humble note: i already have all the logic for these features worked out.. im just too lazy / dont care to program them at this moment
