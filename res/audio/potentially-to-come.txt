so an idea i had was to make a offline version of this app.

or at least make this app accessible both with internet and without.

the way it would work, is id download clips off youtube of lofi (30min-1h), then id just play at a random point when selected.

that would be a offline "stream".

those mp3 files would be in this directory. But im not doin that right now :)
